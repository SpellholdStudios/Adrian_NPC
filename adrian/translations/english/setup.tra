@73   = ~The years following Adrian's travels with <CHARNAME> were surprisingly quiet. Finding himself with too many questions and no true answers, he soon gave up adventuring and took up residence near a temple of Azuth in Cimbar. A life of contemplation, however, ultimately proved unsuitable, and he was encouraged to leave the city after a violent clash with a Chessentan nobleman. Shortly after Bane's resurrection and the resurgence of his church, Adrian relocated to Waterdeep. He would claim the two incidents unrelated, but most believed that for his own protection, he had entered into an arrangement with the Blackstaff. While the truth of this is uncertain, Adrian remained well behaved and is believed to have kept his dealings with the Waterdhavian underworld reasonably limited. He never married nor had children of his own, though he eventually chose to take on apprentices. How he found time to teach them whilst embroiled in Waterdhavian intrigue is considered one of Faerun's greatest mysteries.~

@75   = ~Adrian's experiences with <CHARNAME> further embittered him. Never a great admirer of elves, he found his fury towards the late Irenicus turning more and more upon the people of Suldanessellar who, in his mind, had created the monster. Adrian wandered the northern lands for a time after his travels with <CHARNAME>, trying without success to alleviate his bitterness. In failure, he finally returned home to the Moonsea, where he truly came into his power. Taking advantage of the recent turmoil within the ranks of the Zhentarim, he lured away a number of members, promising them the wealth of Suldanessellar instead. This ultimately proved to be his undoing, as he would meet his end at the hands of the famous ranger Drizzt Do'Urden, on the very steps of the city he had once helped to save.~
@76   = ~Despite his assurances that he would survive without her, the months following <CHARNAME>'s ascension were surprisingly difficult for Adrian.

How they lured so powerful a mage to his death is uncertain, though it is a long established fact that any man can be bested. Their intent, however, was all too clear.
